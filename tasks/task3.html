    <h2>The Basics of Web Development</h2>
<p>Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. It involves a combination of skills,
     including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provides the structure for web pages, CSS is used for styling and layout,
      and JavaScript adds interactivity. Understanding these fundamental technologies is crucial for anyone starting in
       the field of web development. By mastering the basics, developers can build responsive, visually appealing, and 
       functional websites that deliver great user experiences.</p><br>

       <h2>Understanding Responsive Design</h2>

<p class="الخط">Responsive design is an approach to web design that ensures websites work seamlessly across a variety of devices,
     from desktops to smartphones. The key principle of responsive design is to create flexible layouts that adapt
      to different screen sizes and resolutions. This is achieved using media queries in CSS, which allow designers 
      to apply different styles depending on the device's characteristics. As mobile traffic continues to grow, 
      having a responsive website is essential for reaching a broad audience and improving user engagement.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Accessibility in Web Design</h2>

<p class="شطب">Web accessibility ensures that websites are usable by people with disabilities, such as those with visual, auditory,
     or motor impairments. Implementing accessible design practices can help create a more inclusive web. Some common
      accessibility features include providing text alternatives for images (using alt text), ensuring proper color 
      contrast, and enabling keyboard navigation. Accessibility not only improves the user experience for people with 
      disabilities but also benefits search engine optimization (SEO) and overall usability.</p>
